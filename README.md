## Overview
For this project, I targeted a niche audience and created a useful, purposeful application for them.  Through the pandemic, students had to learn remotely and their caregivers often had to juggle working from home full time and supporting the students in their learning.  I created an app that families could use at the dinner table to test their knowledge, learn new information, and have fun together!

## Learning Goals
- Demonstrate mastery with React, React Router, asynchronous JavaScript, and end to end testing with Cypress
- Create User Personas to target my niche audience
- Work within time constraints to deliver a product for my niche audience

## Features
Users can choose a category of questions.

Users can view all their saved cards together, and can also un-save cards from that view.

## Project Reflection

- This project was an opportunity for me to demonstrate my mastery of React and Cypress, while highlighting my problem solving skills and ability to produce DRY code. I am proud of this work and my growth as a developer!

## Future Iterations

- Users will be able to filter questions by true/false or multiple choice questions
- Users will be able to add comments to the question cards for their review
